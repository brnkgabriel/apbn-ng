Ladies and Gentlemen 
As the date of this Annual General Assembly was approaching, I found myself filled 
with mixed feelings - torn between the immense responsibility ahead and the thought 
of whether or not I will find the strength of conviction that will drive me to lead this 
great Association. What reassured me was the unwavering passion of so many of you, 
my colleagues on the Board and Executive Council, who are committed to serving 
APBN and your professional bodies with excellence and dedication. It is your spirit 
of service that inspired me to accept the mantle of leadership, and it is my belief in 
what we do at APBN, and what we can achieve together, that fuels my determination 
to push forward. 
I stand before you today deeply honoured and humbled by the trust you have placed 
in me to serve as the President of the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria 
(APBN) for the next two years. I accept this responsibility with a profound sense of 
duty, recognising the immense opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for our 
Association, for the professional bodies we represent, and for the nation at large. 
As we gather today, I am reminded of the great legacy that has been built by those 
who came before me. In particular, I wish to express my deepest gratitude to our 
Immediate Past President, Mr. Manason Garkuwa Rubainu, for his transparent 
leadership and his dedication in successfully leading the Association for the past two 
years. Under his stewardship, APBN has made significant strides, and I am 
committed to building on the solid foundation laid by Mr Rubainu and indeed our 
seventeen Respected Past Presidents of APBN. 
The Role of Professionals and Professional Bodies in Nation-Building 
Professionals and professional bodies occupy a unique position in shaping the future 
of any country. We drive innovation, promote ethical standards, and foster sustainable 
economic development. Our work spans across industries and sectors, and our 
contributions have a profound impact on the society at large. 
As professionals, we are the architects of our nation’s infrastructure - both physical 
and institutional. Accountants, Engineers, Doctors, Lawyers, Surveyors, Pharmacists, 
Bankers, Insurers, Computer Scientists, Mining & Geophysicists, Medical Lab 
Scientists, Marketers, and many more, we are the backbone of economic 
development. By driving innovation, creating jobs, and upholding integrity, we 
stimulate growth and ensure the stability of our economy. But our role doesn’t stop at 
economic contributions. 
We are also responsible for upholding ethical standards and governance. In a world 
where integrity is often in question, we stand as custodians of accountability and 
good governance. The professional standards and codes of ethics we uphold within 
our various bodies are essential in maintaining public trust and confidence in our 
institutions. 
Furthermore, professionals are educators and mentors, nurturing the next generation 
of leaders. By building human capital, we shape the future workforce and leadership 
of our country. We provide guidance and mentorship, ensuring that the next 
generation is well-equipped to carry the mantle of responsibility in the years to come. 
Our advocacy role is crucial as well. As APBN, we are committed to being the strong, 
united voice of all professionals in Nigeria, advocating in the public interest and 
shaping policies that advance the nation’s priorities. 
My Vision for APBN 2024-2026
As I step into this role, I am guided by a clear vision for the future of APBN. I believe 
that we stand at a critical juncture - where the expectations of professionals, 
businesses, industry, governments, regulators, and the public at large have never been 
higher. My vision for APBN over the next two years is rooted in strengthening the 
Association as the unified voice of Nigerian professionals, making us more 
impactful in our advocacy, more resilient in our operations, and more innovative in 
how we support our members. 
Strategic Priorities for 2024 - 2026: 
During my presidency from 2024 to 2026, the focus of the Executive Council will be 
on blending our past successes with future growth and transformation, ensuring that 
the Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN) is agile enough to adapt to 
new challenges and bold enough to set ambitious goals. Our strategic priorities will 
include: 
1. Enhancing Member-Centricity: A New ‘Member Value Proposition’ 
(MVP)
At the heart of my presidency is the goal of ensuring that APBN becomes 
more member-centric. Our primary duty in the Executive Council is to serve 
our member bodies and, by extension, their individual members. We will 
develop a new Member Value Proposition (MVP) that clearly articulates the 
value we create for members. This will be our promise to you about what 
APBN will deliver. We will ensure that the actions of the Executive Council 
reflect the needs and priorities of our diverse membership, and that the 
Secretariat is equipped to deliver the best possible service. As your President, I 
will be directly accountable for delivering on this promise. 
2. A High-Level Strategic Plan
To guide our work and ensure alignment with our long-term objectives, we 
will develop a comprehensive Strategic Plan for APBN. This plan will serve 
as our roadmap, outlining the key initiatives we will undertake to benefit our 
member bodies and stakeholders. It will include proactive monitoring of 
global and national trends, emerging opportunities, and potential risks that 
could impact our ability to serve the public interest. By staying ahead of the 
curve, we will ensure that APBN remains a relevant, forward-looking 
organisation. 
3. The APBN Impact Map: Prioritising Our Work
As part of our strategic efforts, we will create an APBN Impact Map - a 
framework for prioritising our initiatives. This map will clearly define the 
actions we commit to pursuing in collaboration with our members bodies and 
stakeholders over the course of the next two years. The Impact Map will 
ensure that we are focused on the most pressing issues, while also being 
responsive to emerging challenges and opportunities. 
Key Initiatives for the 2024-2026 Presidential Term: 
With the consensus of my colleagues on the Executive Council and subject to the 
support and approval of the APBN Board, we will pursue a number of initiatives 
during the next two years including: 
1. Launch of a ‘Professionals TV Station’
One of our major projects will be the creation of of APBN TV Station. While 
we don’t intend to set up a traditional TV station with costly transmitters and 
overheads, we plan to leverage on Mobile App enabled design modelled on 
the success of "ICAN on Air" and using YouTube or similar technology to 
create an accessible, dynamic platform. This station will broadcast daily, 
showcasing the work of member professional institutes and their individual 
members. It will feature specially designed programming such as news and 
current affairs, continuing professional development (CPD) programs, and 
guidance and counselling sessions, all tailored to individual professionals, as 
well as current and future students. While this is an ambitious goal, I believe 
that through collective effort and collaboration, we can make it a reality. This 
station will not only serve as a platform to highlight our professional 
achievements but will also be a tool for engaging the wider public and 
fostering professional growth. 
2. Establishment of ‘APBN Training and Skills Development Programme’
I am particularly excited about the vision to establish APBN Training & Skills 
Development Programme - a not-for-profit initiative that will provide cuttingedge training, industry-relevant certifications, and hands-on job skills to 
millions of young Nigerians. This programme will play a crucial role in 
building a strong, skilled workforce for Nigeria, equipping the next generation 
of professionals with the tools they need to succeed in today’s fast-evolving 
job market. I envision every Nigerian professional body playing an active role 
in this transformative project, contributing to the development of our nation's 
human capital. 
3. Revitalising Constitutional Standing Committees
Another key focus will be the resuscitation and revitalisation of our 
Constitutional Standing Committees as enshrined in Clause 13.1 of the APBN 
Constitution. These committees have always been essential to the smooth 
functioning of APBN, and we will work tirelessly to ensure they are fully 
operational, bringing valuable insights and expertise to the table. Their work 
will be instrumental in supporting the strategic objectives of the Association, 
enhancing governance, and ensuring that all member bodies are effectively 
represented. 
4. Revamping Financial Sustainability:
Financial sustainability is critical to the long-term success of our Association. 
To achieve this, we will not only develop a diversified funding model but 
also we will carry out a cost optimisation process to ensure that going 
forward every financial expenditure is justified and that the Association 
receives commensurate value for every Naira spent. This disciplined approach 
will enable us to better manage our resources while enhancing the impact of 
our initiatives. 
5. Re-engaging Inactive Members:
It is also important to acknowledge that some of our member bodies have 
become inactive over time. We will work tirelessly to re-engage these 
inactive members and bring them back to full participation. A united and 
engaged APBN is a stronger APBN, and I believe that every professional body 
has an essential role to play in shaping our collective future. 
6. Others: 
Other areas we will work to make impact include: 
- Advocating for public policy initiatives with input from Member Bodies. 
- Showcasing Nigerian expertise through well thought out talent show. 
- Encouraging ethical practices particularly now that professionals are blamed 
for most of the challenges of our dear nation. 
- Forging cooperation and partnerships among Member Bodies and other 
global organisations.
I strongly count on the collaboration and support of my colleagues on the Executive 
Council and the APBN Board to successfully conceptualise and execute these 
initiatives. 
Gratitude and Recognition
Before I conclude, I would like to take a moment to express my sincere appreciation 
to the President of my mother Institute, the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Nigeria (ICAN) Chief DCS Alaribe FCA, the Governing Council, and the 
Registrar/CEO of ICAN. I thank you for nominating me to represent ICAN on the 
APBN Executive Council from 2018 to date. Your unflinching support and presence 
here in large numbers to witness my investiture is a testament to the strong bonds we 
share. I am deeply honoured and look forward to working with ICAN to further the 
objectives of both our organisations. 
I must also take a special moment to recognise Sir Herbert Adewale Agbebiyi FCA, 
FCA, respected Past President of APBN 2004 - 2006 and Chair of APBN Board of 
Trustees. Sir Agbebiyi is also the Chairman of the Body of Past Presidents of ICAN 
where I have the honour and privilege of serving as General Secretary. Sir, your 
support and your presence here today, traveling all the way from Lagos, means a 
great deal to me. As someone I deeply respect, your mentorship and guidance will be 
invaluable as I embark on this new journey. 
Conclusion
In closing, I want to reaffirm my commitment to leading APBN with integrity, 
transparency, and a shared vision for a stronger, more unified Association. Together, 
we will revitalise our internal structures, re-engage our members, and ensure that 
APBN remains a powerful force for positive change in Nigeria. By working 
collectively and purposefully, I have no doubt that we will achieve great things for 
our Association and our country. 
Thank you for your trust, your support, and your belief in our shared future. Let us go 
forward with passion, dedication, and a relentless focus on nation-building. 
Thank you.
