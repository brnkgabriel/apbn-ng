The Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) was established in 1963. The body attained the status of a Chartered Institute in June 1990 through Decree No. 16 (now an Act of the National Assembly) from which it derives the power and responsibility  to register members, set parameters of knowledge to acquire to qualify to practise, regulate the practice and development of the PR Profession as well monitor professional conducts through an established Code of Ethics, amongst others. As it is the practice with respectable professional organizations everywhere, the law stipulates  standard academic and professional qualifications for admission into the Institute.





NIPR's responsibilities are:

To provide a professional structure for the practice of public relations.





To enhance the ability and status of our members as professional practitioners.





To represent and serve the professional interests of our members.





To provide opportunities for members to meet and exchange views and ideas.





To raise standards within the profession through the promotion of best practice – including the production of best practice guides, case studies, training events and our continuous professional development scheme ‘Developing Excellence’.
