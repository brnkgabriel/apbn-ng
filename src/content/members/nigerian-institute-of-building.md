The Nigerian Institute of Building has its origin in a parent body called the Buildersâ€™ Society, which was founded in 1834 by a number of prominent Builders in London. This body was renamed the Institute of Builders in 1884. Then in 1965, the name was changed to Institute of Building IOB. As the organisation gained royal charter, it was renamed "The Chartered Institute of Building" (CIOB) in 1980.

Institute of Building Nigeria Centre was formed by the IOB Nigerian members, who had returned home after studying building in the United Kingdom.

This overseas centre of the London based Institute of Building was officially inaugurated on Friday, 31st March, 1967 at the Auditorium of the Advanced Teachers Training College, University of Lagos, Akoka, Yaba, Lagos under the distinguished Chairmanship of Sir. Mobolaji Bank-Anthony, KBE, FRSA, F. INST. D.

The first Chairman of Institute of Building Nigeria Centre (by the election held on 26th March, 1967) was Mr. Simeon Oladiran Okikiolu. He was succeeded through election in 1968 by Mr. Fatai Isola Osikoya. The IOB Nigeria Centre sought for autonomy in 1969 and it was granted by Institute of Building in London. Hence, the Nigerian Institute of Building (NIOB) was established in 1969.
