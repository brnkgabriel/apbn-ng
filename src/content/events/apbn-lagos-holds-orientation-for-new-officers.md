The Association of Professional Bodies of Nigeria (APBN), Lagos Chapter, at its last Annual General Meeting (AGM) produced a new set of officials to oversee the affairs of the association for the next two years.

APBN has been recognised as part of the Organised Private Sector (OPS) since 1992 and has been instrumental in shaping informed policies through expert recommendations.

In a statement, the body held an orientation programme to prepare the newly elected executives for their roles and responsibilities with seasoned facilitators, who were also past chairmen of the association in persons of Alhaji Wasiu Akewusola and Mrs Lynda Onefeli.

The new executives are: Bldr. Asimiyu Towolawi Bashir (Chairman); Arc. Majekodunmi Babalola (Vice Chairman); Tpl. Rasheed Osinowo (General Secretary), Mrs. Aroloye Olubusola (Public Relations Officer).

Others are: QS. Farotimi Olanrewaju (Financial Secretary), Bldr. Adesanya Olufemi (Treasurer) and Mr. Olamide Balogun (Auditor).

In his remark, Chairman of APBN Lagos Chapter, Bashir expressed his gratitude to both the facilitators and his executive members for their participation in the programme.

He highlighted the importance of equipping leaders with the necessary knowledge and tools to meet the demands of their positions.

Bashir commended the facilitators (both ex-secretaries and chairmen of the association) for their invaluable contributions to APBN over the years, noting that their dedication and achievements had set high standards and served as an inspiration for others.

He further emphasised the pivotal role of APBN as the umbrella body for professional institutes, institutions, and associations in Nigeria that serves as a unified professional advisor to the government and promotes cooperation among professionals to address national issues effectively.

The orientation programme featured well-researched lectures designed to provide insights into the association’s structure, objectives, and the expectations of executive roles.
