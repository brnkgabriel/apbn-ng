The institute is a professional and examining body established in 1987 and chartered by Act No.103, published in the Federal Government of Nigeria Gazette No.76 Vol.79 of 31st December 1992.

The Act empowers the institute to, among other things; regulate the training and practice of Administration in public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy within a professional membership framework.

As a profession in the centre of attraction and constantly in the mainstream of industrial development, the contributions of professional administration specialisms  to sustain and maintain a robust economy are very crucial and significant.

As national development change with a tremendous relative rapidity, so do management and administrative approaches to cope and keep them afloat. It is inconceivable to think of any industrial and economic developments on their own without the contribution  of skilled administrators.
